# App Assets

This guide contains some resources available for developers to use in their apps
to improve consistency, as well as for convenience. For example, most
`ActionBarLayer` implementations will require at least one of the common icons
given below.

## Pebble Timeline Pin Icons

> Editor's note:
> The file below is available at https://developer.rebble.io/developer-assets.getpebble.com/assets/other/pebble-timeline-icons-pdc.zip
> and will need to have it and others like it moved to this project.

Many timeline pin icons are available

described in `Link: Vector Graphics` for use in watchfaces and watchapps. These
